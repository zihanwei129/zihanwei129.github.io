<strong>Bidirectional Flow in Volcanic Conduit and Bubble Dynamics</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Applying computational fluid dynamics to model magma flow in volcanic conduits and bridge magma flow with various observational data. The goal is to understand volcanic degassing processes and eruption dynamics.

<strong>Reducing sampling bias of landslides by identifying unrecorded events from satellite images</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Global records of landslides are subjected to incompleteness and sampling bias because of spatially different levels of monitoring and reporting. In this work, we use a convolutional neural network to detect landslides from globally available satellite images and compare the detection with existing records of landslides. We train the model using an open high-resolution landslide dataset containing labeled landslide and non-landslide satellite images from the Bijie region in China. We test the trained model on low-resolution satellite images of Oregon, USA and Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda taken by Sentinel-2, which provides global coverage. To achieve better generalization of our model, we conduct multiple operations including downsampling the original training set to match the lower resolution of the test images, data augmentation, and distribution matching for the input test images. We visualize the model's decision making process using Grad-CAM. By comparing the detected landslides with the existing record, we find that the landslides in Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda are much more under-reported than in Oregon, USA. This work can be used to detect potentially unrecorded landslides and understand the landslide sampling bias globally.

<strong>Optimizing Contact Tracing Policies for COVID-19</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>We use agent-based modeling to optimize contact tracing policies for COVID-19 in San Francisco, CA. We focus on the effect different types of contact tracing, and different work types.

<strong>Quantifying Groundwater Storage in Central Valley, California Using GRACE Data and Head Measurements</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i> I study the groundwater storage change in California's Central Valley during 2002-2017 using the GRACE data and the in-situ well measurements. We also find that highly variable groundwater level indicates confined aquifer.
