<strong>Bidirectional Flow in Volcanic Conduit and Bubble Dynamics</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>Applying computational fluid dynamics to model magma flow in volcanic conduits and bridge magma flow with various observational data. The goal is to understand volcanic degassing processes and eruption dynamics.

<strong>Optimizing Contact Tracing Policies for COVID-19</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>We use agent-based modeling to optimize contact tracing policies for COVID-19 in San Francisco, CA. We focus on the effect different types of contact tracing, and different work types. This work is part of the COVID-19 project of Stanford Future Bay Initiative. <a href="http://bay.stanford.edu/covid19">Read more</a>

<strong>Quantifying Groundwater Storage in Central Valley, California Using GRACE Data and Head Measurements</strong><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i> I study the groundwater storage change in California's Central Valley during 2002-2017 using the GRACE data and the in-situ well measurements. The recorded variations in groundwater level can also inform the aquifer properties.
