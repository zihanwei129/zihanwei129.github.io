<p>I was born in Sichuan, China, a place famous for pandas, spicy food and gorgeous natural landscape. I've been deeply attracted by earth science since my childhood.</p>
<p>I am currently a PhD student in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. My research interest is on understanding multi-phase flow on earth such as magma flow and permafrost degassing using computational fluid dynamics. Besides earth scicence, I'm also deeply interested in computer graphics, especially animation, which actually has many similarities with simulating the earth! Before entering graduate school, I got my Bachelor's degree in Geology from Peking University and did a research internship in University of California, Berkeley for 2 months. I am also doing research on quantifying groundwater storage in Central Valley, California using GRACE data as well as trying to figure out accurate ways to compute groundwater storage using head measurements from wells.</p>
<p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy birdwatching, hiking, photography and traveling. I am also a member of Stanfor Badminton Club. I am very interested in computer graphics, which actually has many similarities with simulating the earth!</p>
