<p>I was born in Sichuan, China, a place famous for pandas, spicy food and gorgeous natural landscape. I've been deeply attracted by earth and environmental sciences since my childhood.</p>
<p>I'm currently a Data Scientist at Global Fishing Watch, where I work on providing insights and data products to improve the transparency of human activities at the ocean for the its conservation and sustainability.
<p>I did my PhD in Geophysics at Stanford, with a minor in computer science. My work focuses on environmental modeling, sustainable agriculture, volcanology, hydrology and natural hazards. My work covers a broad range including modeling multiphase magma flow, attributing sources of surface water pollution, applying remote sensing in sustainable agriculture, detecting landslides using satellite images, optimizing contact tracing policy for COVID-19, and using data to monitor groundwater storage. I'm also interested in computer graphics, especially animation, which actually has many similarities with simulating the earth! Before entering graduate school, I got my Bachelor's degree in Geology from Peking University and did a research internship in University of California, Berkeley for 2 months.</p>
<p>Outside of my work, I enjoy watching wildlife, hiking, photography and traveling. I am a member of Stanford Birdwatching Club and Stanford Badminton Club.</p>
