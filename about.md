<p>I was born in Sichuan, China, a place famous for pandas, spicy food and gorgeous natural landscape. I've be deeply attracted by earth science from my childhood.</p>
<p>I am currently a PhD student in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. My research interest is on understanding multi-phase flow on earth such as magma flow and permafrost degassing using computational fluid dynamics. Before entering graduate school, I got my Bachelor's degree in Geology from Peking University and did a research internship in University of California, Berkeley for 2 months. I am also doing research on quantifying groundwater storage in Central Valley, California using GRACE data as well as trying to figure out accurate ways to compute groundwater storage using head measurements from wells.</p>
<p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy hiking, photography and traveling. I am also a member of Stanfor Badminton Club. I am very interested in computer graphics, which actually has many similarities with simulating the earth!</p>
