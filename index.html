Welcome! I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://sigma.stanford.edu">SIGMA</a> group in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. 
					My research focuses on environmental fluid dynamics, volcanology, and groundwater hydrology. I'm also interested in agent-based modeling, numerical modeling related to animation, and applying machine learning to solve real-world environmental problems. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a>
