Welcome! I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://sigma.stanford.edu">SIGMA</a> group in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. 
					My research focuses on understanding multi-phase magma flow in volcanic conduits using direct numerical simulations. I'm also interested in computer graphics, especially animation and simulation.
					Besides the field related to numerical simulations, I'm also interested in the groundwater management in Central Valley, California 
					using the different types of data. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a>
