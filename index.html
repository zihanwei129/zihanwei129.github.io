<p>Welcome! I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://sigma.stanford.edu">SIGMA</a> group in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. I'm also pursuing a PhD minor in computer science. My work focuses on <strong>applying numerical modeling and data-model integration to different earth systems</strong>, including volcanoes, sustainable agriculture, water resources and pollution, and natural hazards. I'm eager about <strong>using my knowledge and skills to pursue our sustainable future, with a harmony of nature and our society</strong>.</p>
<p>I was born in Sichuan, China, a place famous for pandas, spicy food and most importantly, gorgeous natural landscape. I've been deeply attracted by earth science since my childhood. Before coming to Stanford, I got my Bachelor's degree in Geology from Peking University, where I established an <strong>educated love of our Earth and the resolution of devoting myself to its future</strong>.</p>
