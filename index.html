Welcome! I'm a PhD student at <a href="http://sigma.stanford.edu">SIGMA</a> group in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. I'm also pursuing a PhD minor in computer science.
					My work focuses on applying numerical modeling and data-model integration to different earth systems, including volcanoes, sustainable agriculture, water resources and pollution, and natural hazards. I'm eager about pursuing a sustainable future, with a harmony of nature and our society. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a>
