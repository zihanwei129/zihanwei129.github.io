<p>Welcome! I'm a Data Scientist at <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a>, where I work on providing insights and data products to improve the transparency of human activities at the ocean for the its conservation and sustainability. I'm eager about <strong>using my knowledge and skills to pursue our sustainable future, with a harmony of nature and our society</strong>.</p>
<p>I earned my PhD degree from Stanford University at the <a href="http://sigma.stanford.edu">SIGMA</a> group in Department of Geophysics, Stanford University. I also earned a PhD minor in computer science. My work focuses on <strong>applying numerical modeling and data-model integration to different earth systems</strong>, including volcanoes, sustainable agriculture, water resources and pollution, and natural hazards.</p>
<p>I was born in Sichuan, China, a place famous for pandas, spicy food and most importantly, gorgeous natural landscape. I've been deeply attracted by earth science since my childhood. Before coming to Stanford, I got my Bachelor's degree in Geology from Peking University, where I established an <strong>educated love of our Earth and the resolution of devoting myself to its future</strong>.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy birdwatching, finding and learning about wildlife, hiking, backpacking, and cooking diverse cuisines from different cultures. I was the vice president of <a href="https://birding.stanford.edu/">Stanford Birdwatching Club</a> in 2022-2023.</p>
